July 2nd Beginning of Week 1

Website is rough draft of layout of figma design. Right now connecting python backend code is
being connected to front end to be displayed. Therefore, arcithecture of website plan has been laid out. 

You can look at website from the html file and click open browser in sublime IDE but none of the buttons work
Backend folder is now being worked on where a flask app is being created for python and a JSON file is used to
output data.


July 11 Beginning of Week 2

Website is still a rough draft, over the week end and some of today I got the front end connected to the backend. 
User input can be taken from the frontend and sent via HTTP POST and GET to a local server started by the flask
app where different pages are brought up or actions happen based on the user's input and is controlled by flask.

Next steps will be to send a sentence to the backend and for the data to be updated as well as the user interface
